        <p>
            I am in my third year at NAU and aim to get a degree in computer science that I can use for a couple of years until my true dreams become reality. I have had the privilege to be introduced to people who retired by the age of thirty and they are teaching me to do so. The impact I want to leave on this world far exceeds the salary of a software developer and my dream is too large to leave behind. This way, I get the best of both worlds; I get the title, I can leave this world knowing I helped others and hey, I have my degree to sit on my wall and look gorgeous knowing what it took for me to EARN it.

        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Python ~ I have about a yearâ€™s worth of experience programming in Python</li>
                <li>C++ ~ I have experience developing in C++ predominantly in analytics</li>
                <li>Java ~ I have recently taken on Java but the similarity to C is what I admire the most</li>
                <li>C ~ Last but not least, this beautiful language is what I pride myself on and is the one that I develop the best in (specifically in creating mini-games)</li>

        <h2>Personal Projects</h2>

        <h3>BattleShip</h3>
        <p>
            Battleship is a board game that I used to play all the time with my cousins when I was growing up. Recently I was able to program the game in C code and admittedly it is not as fun as when I was a child, however, being able to create it is something that I am still proud of. The goal of the game is to shoot the opposite person's ships down while they do the same. The first person to shoot their opponent's ships wins.

        <h3>Turtle</h3>
        <p>
            During one of my previous courses, I dabbled in using Turtle. Although it was quite challenging, I recreated an Etch A Sketch toy which was extremely fun. Creating my childhood games through code has been an experience like no other. The outcome is to draw what you want and the screen will display it.

        <h2>Education and Experience</h2>
        <p>
            I have learned everything I know at NAU. Before college, I had not touched a single program. In addition, this is my first time taking the time to learn HTML. I have general knowledge, however, I am a beginner.
